# Python-Machine-Learning

Hello! This is a sample of the code I wrote in an internship at a Machine Learning Lab at the University of Arizona. This internship was completed during the summer after my junior year and during my senior year. 

After learning Python, I went to work on three different classification problems, each with datasets of different sizes. The first required the classification of different types of glass, as is done for forensic analysis. The second problem was about classifying various biomolecules to make QSAR models, and the third problem was to test whether or not a given room was occupied, according to various parameters like light, temperature, and humidity of the room.

The data and problems were all taken from public UCI repositories, and everything is in Python. The algorithms featured in my research project are decision trees, K-NN (or K-Nearest Neighbor), ridge regression, and support vector machines.

I used open source modules developed by scikit-learn, whose website can be found here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/#

Along with the python files, I've posted a small sample of the results I accumulated, including graphs and charts depicting the decision trees I made.
